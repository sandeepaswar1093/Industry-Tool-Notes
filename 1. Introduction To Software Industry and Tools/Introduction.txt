	Package = No.Of years of exp * 5 - 6 lakhs


Service Based Companies
-----------------------
The companies which are developing projects based on client requirements are called as Service based comapnies.

Railway Ticket Booking

Net Banking

Swiggy & Zomoto

Zoom

Types of project
----------------
1) Scratch development projects (10 %)

2) Maintenence/Support projects (75 %)

3) Migration projects (15 %)


-> Brand new projects are called as Scratch development projects. We will start project development from beginning.

-> We need to provide maintenence/support for the projects which are running in public domain.

	-> We will get change requests (CR)
	-> We will get enhancements
	-> We will get bugs

-> Projects which are changing from one technology to another technology comes under migration projects.


	IBM Mainframes --------------------> Java 

	EJB 	----------------------------> Spring Boot

Functional domain represents what type of services we are providing from our project

   Onshore Team is also called as Onsite team.

-> Team team which is working in non-client location is called as Offshore team

-> Onshore & Offshore teams will communicate through bridge calls for project discussions.

-> In companies we will use below softwares for bridge calls
